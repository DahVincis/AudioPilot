# AudioPilot

AudioPilot is a PyQt6-based application designed to control audio mixing consoles. It utilizes the Python OSC library for real-time communication with the mixer, provides a graphical user interface for controlling various audio parameters, and dynamically adjusts Parametric equalization for a single channel.

## Features

- Real-time audio mixer control via OSC
- Graphical User Interface using PyQt6
- Responsive RTA (Real-Time Analyzer) display
- EQ and filter adjustments
- Channel selection and control
- Audio pitch correction options

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DahVincis/AudioPilot
cd AudioPilot
```

### Install Dependencies

Create and activate a virtual environment (Optional):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Packaging the Application

This project uses PyInstaller to package the application into a standalone executable. If you have already packaged the project, you should find the executable in the `dist` directory.

To package the application yourself, run:

```bash
pyinstaller main.spec
```

This will generate a standalone executable in the `dist/AudioPilot` directory.

## Usage

To run the application, simply execute the generated `AudioPilot.exe` file found in the `dist/AudioPilot` directory.

If you are running the application from source, use:

```bash
python main.py
```

### GUI Overview

- **Mute/Fine**: Toggle mute and fine adjustments.
- **Channel**: Select the audio channel to control.
- **EQ Controls**: Adjust the frequency, quality, and gain for different EQ bands.
- **Pitch Correction**: Select and apply pitch correction.
