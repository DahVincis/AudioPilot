Frequency manage:
    Each band will have a set amount of frequencies, of the frequencies in 
    that band we will pick the frequency with the highest dB value. 
    This will determine the frequency position of the band.

    Low Frequency Band Parameters: (refer to frequency_OSC for OSC message values)
        Range: 124.7 - 306.2 Hz

    Low Mid Frequency Band Parameters:
        Range: 317.0 - 1k55 Hz

    High Mid Frequency Band Parameters:
        Range: 1k60 - 5k02 Hz

    High Frequency Band Parameters:
        Range: 5k20 - 20k00 Hz

Gain lvl:
    For the gain level, first we set the band to the minimum dB value 
    for that band. Then we need to get the distance value from the dB 
    level of the frequency to the set "frequency flat" (-45 dB), say 
    the frequency 400Hz is selected and it is -20dB; from -20 to -45 is 
    25 in distance. That distance we divide by 10. After that we 
    multiply that by the band multiplier to get our gain value. 
    This gain value will influence (increase or decrease) according to 
    the parameters set for the EQ. Whether it is Low Pitch (or male), 
    High Pitch (or female), Mid Pitch (Flat).

    Final Formula: ((dbFreqValue - freqFlat) / 10) * bandMultiplier

    Low Pitch (Men):
        Low Band: decrease; min value: -4dB | max value: -12dB
        LowMid Band: decrease; min value: -2dB | max value: -10dB
        MidHigh Band: increase; min value: 0dB | max value: 6.5dB
        High Band: increase; min value: 0dB | max value: 6dB
    High Pitch (Women):
        Low Band: decrease; min value: 0dB | max value: -6.5dB
        LowMid Band: decrease; min value: -1dB | max value: -7dB
        MidHigh Band: decrease; min value: -2dB | max value: -8dB
        High Band: decrease; min value: -3dB | max value: -6.5dB 

    Mid Pitched ("Flat"):
        Low Band: decrease; min value: 0dB | max value: -7dB
        LowMid Band: decrease; min value: 0dB | max value: -6dB
        MidHigh Band: increase; min value: 0dB | max value: 4dB
        High Band: decrease; min value: 0dB | max value: -4dB

Q value:
    After the frequency position is determined we can begin to calculate the
    necessary Q value. We will grab the dB value of the selected frequency 
    and check if there are frequencies that have a close value to the one 
    selected. The more frequencies there are the higher the Q value. 
    The amount the Q value increases is based on limit of the q value for 
    that band (e.g. Low band: max: 7.0, min 3.0; 7-3 = 4; qLim = 4) integer 
    divided by the total amount of frequencies in that band. 
    (e.g. Low band: 20 to 300 Hz = 10 total; bandSize = 10) 
    We then grab that value and multiply it by the amount of frequencies 
    that have a similar dB value to the initial selected frequency (freqSize).

    Final Formula: len(freqSize) * ((qMax - qMin)// len(lowBand))
